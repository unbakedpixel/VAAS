# VORTEX-ADHESION AIR SCRUBBER (VAAS)

> A low-energy, filter-less, ozone-free particulate matter (PM) exposure reduction system  
> designed for long-term, low-maintenance operation in polluted urban environments.

## 1. Overview

VAAS (Vortex-Adhesion Air Scrubber) is a **passive–active hybrid air cleaning system** that removes airborne particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) using **geometry, airflow control, and surface adhesion**, rather than disposable filters, ionization, or chemical processes.

The system is designed around a **tall vertical column (≈6 ft / 1.8 m)** that gently pulls ambient air upward through a **helical flow path** formed by a **flat twisted internal sheet** inside a cylindrical outer shell.

Instead of aggressively filtering air, VAAS:
- slows air,
- forces repeated curved trajectories,
- pushes particles into boundary layers,
- and relies on **microscale adhesion forces** to permanently capture them.

This design prioritizes:
- **longevity**
- **low power**
- **zero consumables**
- **visible, verifiable dust capture**
- **safety (no ozone, no chemicals)**

---

## 2. Design Philosophy

Most air purification systems optimize for **instantaneous efficiency** at the cost of:
- high pressure drop
- filter replacement
- high energy use
- silent failure when clogged

VAAS instead optimizes for:

> **Lifetime-integrated particulate removal per watt, per unit of maintenance.**

This makes it suitable not just as a gadget, but as **infrastructure**.

Key principles:
- Continuous operation beats burst performance
- Exposure reduction matters more than city-wide AQI averages
- Predictable failure modes are better than silent ones
- Decade-scale operation matters more than peak efficiency

## 3. Physical Configuration (Full-Scale Model)

### Geometry
- **Height:** ~6 ft (1.8 m)
- **Diameter:** 30–40 cm (recommended)
- **Orientation:** Vertical
- **Flow direction:** Bottom → Top (pulled by fans)

### Internal Structure
- A **flat sheet** twisted helically around the central axis
- Typical total twist: **360°–540°**
- Pitch chosen to avoid flow choking while maximizing near-wall exposure

### External Structure
- Cylindrical outer tube
- One side may be transparent for inspection and documentation
- Internal surfaces backed by rigid material (metal or polymer)

### Airflow System
- Low-speed axial fans mounted at the **top**
- Fans operate in **pull configuration** (negative pressure)
- Typical airflow: **50–150 m³/h** depending on scale and fan choice
- Power: **~5–10 W per unit**

---

## 4. Operating Principle (How It Works)

VAAS relies on **stacked weak physical effects** rather than a single strong mechanism.

### 4.1 Inertial Impaction
Air follows curved streamlines easily; particles do not.

When airflow bends around the twisted sheet:
- particles lag behind due to inertia
- heavier particles (PM10) deviate more strongly
- lighter particles (PM2.5) deviate probabilistically

This causes particles to drift toward surfaces.

---

### 4.2 Centrifugal Drift
Helical motion introduces centrifugal acceleration:

\[
a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}
\]

Even at low velocities (≈0.3–0.8 m/s), repeated curvature causes particles to migrate outward toward walls.

---

### 4.3 Boundary-Layer Trapping
Near any solid surface:
- air velocity drops toward zero
- turbulence collapses
- particles entering this region lose escape energy

Once in the boundary layer, particles are far more likely to impact and stick.

---

### 4.4 Surface Adhesion (Critical Mechanism)

Once a particle contacts a surface, airflow physics largely stops mattering.

Dominant forces:
- **Van der Waals attraction**
- **Electrostatic polarization** (even without active charging)
- **Mechanical interlocking** with surface roughness or fibers

At micron scales, these forces **exceed aerodynamic lift** at VAAS operating velocities.

This is why:
- dust sticks to walls,
- buildings blacken over time,
- filters work without glue.

---

### 4.5 Probabilistic Capture Over Multiple Passes

VAAS does not rely on 100% capture per pass.

If the probability of capture per interaction is `p`, and the number of interactions is `n`:

\[
P_{\text{capture}} = 1 - (1 - p)^n
\]

With:
- low per-pass probability
- many forced interactions

Capture becomes statistically inevitable.

---

## 5. Why Particles Do Not Re-Enter the Flow

Particles remain attached because:
- adhesion forces dominate at small scales
- airflow velocity near surfaces is low
- no sharp pressure gradients exist to re-entrain them

Re-entrainment occurs only if:
- air velocity is very high
- vibration occurs during airflow
- surfaces are extremely smooth

VAAS is designed to avoid all three.

---

## 6. Expected Performance (Full-Scale 6 ft Model)

### Typical Operating Conditions
- Airflow: 80–120 m³/h
- Average air velocity: 0.3–0.6 m/s
- Residence time: 2–4 seconds
- Power consumption: 5–10 W

### Capture Efficiency (Realistic Ranges)
- **PM10:** ~70–90%
- **PM2.5:** ~40–60%

Efficiency improves with:
- greater height
- more total twist
- lower velocity
- rougher surfaces

---

### Dust Mass Capture (Urban Air Example)

Assuming:
- Total PM concentration ≈ 300 µg/m³
- Air processed ≈ 2,000–3,000 m³/day
- Weighted capture efficiency ≈ 55%

**Dust captured:**  
≈ **0.8–1.5 grams per day per unit**

This is physically verifiable by mass accumulation.

---

## 7. Exposure Reduction vs AQI Reduction

VAAS is **not** intended to significantly change city-wide AQI values.

Instead, it targets **human exposure** at:
- bus stops
- stations
- building interiors
- confined or recirculating spaces

Local reductions of **30–60%** in PM concentration within the exhaust plume are realistic and medically meaningful, even if city AQI remains unchanged.

---

## 8. Comparison With Other Technologies

### HEPA Systems
- High instantaneous efficiency
- High pressure drop
- Frequent filter replacement
- Poor outdoor longevity

### Ion / Static Air Systems
- Moderate efficiency
- Electrode degradation
- Ozone risk
- Regulatory complexity

### Mist / Fog Systems
- Temporary suppression
- No permanent PM removal
- High water and maintenance cost

### VAAS
- Moderate efficiency
- **No consumables**
- **No ozone**
- **Visible, measurable capture**
- **Decade-scale operation**

---

## 9. Maintenance Strategy

VAAS is designed for **forgiving maintenance**, not precision servicing.

### Dust Accumulation
- Gradual surface loading
- Performance degrades slowly, not suddenly

### Optional Dust Shedding
- Periodic low-frequency structural vibration
- Fans OFF during shedding
- Dust falls into bottom tray

### Maintenance Interval
- Outdoor: monthly or quarterly
- Indoor: quarterly or longer

No filters. No disposables.

## 10. Safety Considerations

- No high voltage
- No ionization
- No ozone generation
- No chemical byproducts
- Low noise
- Low temperature rise

Suitable for continuous operation in public or residential environments.

---

## 11. Scaling Strategy

VAAS scales by **replication**, not by brute force.

Examples:
- Multiple units at transit choke points
- One unit per building shaft or atrium
- Distributed exposure reduction instead of centralized megastructures

At scale, the system becomes a **background environmental service**, similar to ventilation or drainage.

---

## 12. Limitations (Honest Disclosure)

VAAS will NOT:
- instantly clean open outdoor air
- replace emission controls
- eliminate the need for policy
- achieve HEPA-level single-pass efficiency

VAAS IS:
- a sustainable exposure reduction layer
- a long-life infrastructure component
- a complement to source reduction, not a substitute

---

## 13. Intended Use of This Repository

This repository exists to:
- document the physics and engineering
- enable replication and improvement
- invite critique and validation
- support pilot deployments and research

It is **not** a finished product.

---

## 14. Status

Current status:
- Full-scale prototype under construction
- Sensor-less validation via mass accumulation and optical visualization
- Long-duration runtime testing underway

Future work:
- Indoor building-scale trials
- Long-term fouling characterization
- Comparative lifecycle cost analysis vs HEPA

---

## 15. License & Ethos

This project prioritizes:
- public health
- scientific honesty
- low-resource applicability
- long-term sustainability

Commercialization, if any, should preserve these principles.

---

## 16. Closing Note

VAAS is not a silver bullet.

It is a **quiet, persistent intervention** that works with physics instead of fighting it.

That is its strength.
